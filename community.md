# Community Structures and Resources for further learning


### Introduction
This course has only covered the basics of a large variety of topics, many of which could be a whole course in itself. The information security environment is also changing on a daily basis and it is impossible for any lone individual to keep up with the latest news, tools etc. However, there is a wider community that Champions should feel part of, beginning with those in the room. This course highlights some of these organisations and structures and explores ways to ensure Champions feel able to be an active part of both using and helping this community to develop.


-This is just a stepping stone
-A much wider community
-Inputs are needed
-Reach out and keep current
-Create own networks

### Learning Goals
* Participants have a full overview of the sources of support they can avail of
* Pathways and resources for future learning - system admin, ethical hacking, forensics etc.

### Assessment Goals
* Participants have connected to the organisations or structures of most relevance to their work


### Recommend Preparations
### Suggested Time

## Activity


    
## Discussion 
* Why would it be useful to share?
* What structures, groups, organisations, people (offline and online) do we already use to share information, keep informed and learn from?
* What would we want to share? (e.g. advice, new methods, indicators of compromise, new tools etc.)
* How can we create a structure from the people here in the room?
* How much would we want to share?
## Inputs 
Lists of useful sources - listserves etc
 
## Deepening 
Setup an agreed and secure method of sharing within the group if that is something that the group wishes to do.

  
## Synthesis
Participants should turn to their assessment documentation and consider how their organisation deals with the subject matter covered in this module. Where necessary they should ask questions and work with other participants to identify any:
 
* Issues they have found that affect their organisations
* Possible solutions they have learned
* Possible difficulties they may face in implementation (ideally using the time and experience of trainers and other participants)
* Things would need to overcome these difficulties
* Connections to other organisations or individuals that would help them
* Timeline, resources and costs for implementation

This should be noted in their assessment, for future use. 

In line with keeping this curriculum as an updated community tool, we would also ask that participants provide comments, feedback and new ideas for this module on the project website and/or Github!



-Have them propose the resources and support networks they use. Especially for localised help.
-Help them create organic support networks with the people in the room where possible. Suggest structure, method, timing etc.
