# Basic Assessment Appendix
Each module of this course had recommended assessment goals. The aim of these is to help each individual:

* Take notes on useful information they have learned throughout the course
* Benefit from the unwritten peer learning that they gain during group work and conversations
* Have a starting point for increasing the security of the organisations that they are working with 

The suggested basic assessment questions are examples and participants should feel free add/remove information on each module that they feel will be relevant. While filling out this assessment in a digital format is recommended, we suggest that any participants take security precautions to protect its sensitive information.
